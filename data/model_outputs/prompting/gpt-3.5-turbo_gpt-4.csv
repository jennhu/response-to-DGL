3,"The new executive who oversaw the middle managers apparently doubted himself on most major decisions","Anaphora","grammatical","C","C","C The sentence ""The new executive who oversaw the middle managers apparently doubted himself on most major decisions"" is grammatically correct in English."
4,"The grimy blacksmith who worked for the royal knights evidently hurt themselves with the sharp tools","Anaphora","ungrammatical","C","N","N The sentence is not grammatically correct because it uses ""themselves,"" which is a plural pronoun, to refer to ""the grimy blacksmith,"" which is a singular noun. The correct pronoun should match the singular noun, so it should be ""himself"" or ""herself"" depending on the blacksmith's gender. If the gender is unknown or if you want to use gender-neutral language, you could use ""themself"" which is increasingly accepted in modern usage. The corrected sentence would be: ""The grimy blacksmith who worked for the royal knights evidently hurt himself with the sharp tools.""
""The grimy blacksmith who worked for the royal knights evidently hurt herself with the sharp tools.""
""The grimy blacksmith who worked for the royal knights evidently hurt themself with the sharp tools."" (gender-neutral)"

13,"The ancient manuscript that the grad student who the new card catalog had confused a great deal was studying in the library was missing a page","Center Embedding","grammatical","N","N","N The sentence is grammatically complex and difficult to follow, but it is not strictly incorrect. It suffers from a lack of clarity due to its nested relative clauses. A clearer way to write this sentence might be: ""The grad student, who was greatly confused by the new card catalog, was studying an ancient manuscript in the library that was missing a page."" This revision breaks down the sentence into more manageable parts, making it easier to understand."
14,"The novel that the horror author who the publishing company had recently fired was banned by the local library","Center Embedding","ungrammatical","N","N","N"
15,"The lullaby that the famous country singer who the record label had signed to a big contract was singing yesterday was written seventy years ago","Center Embedding","grammatical","C","N","N"
16,"The game that the child who the lawnmower had startled in the yard was playing in the morning lasted for hours","Center Embedding","grammatical","N","N","N The sentence is grammatically complex and somewhat awkward, but it is not strictly incorrect. It does, however, suffer from a lack of clarity due to the multiple nested relative clauses. A clearer way to phrase this might be: ""The game that the child, who had been startled by the lawnmower in the yard, was playing in the morning lasted for hours."" This revision makes it clearer that ""who had been startled by the lawnmower in the yard"" is a relative clause describing ""the child,"" and that ""was playing in the morning"" describes the action related to ""the game."""
17,"The crime that the gangster who the story had profiled had planned for weeks was quickly solved","Center Embedding","grammatical","N","C","C The sentence ""The crime that the gangster who the story had profiled had planned for weeks was quickly solved"" is grammatically correct, although it is somewhat complex due to the multiple clauses."
18,"The picture that the artist who the school had expelled for cheating was hurriedly copying was printed in a magazine","Center Embedding","grammatical","N","C","C The sentence is grammatically correct, although it is quite complex and may be difficult to follow due to its structure. It contains multiple clauses and a relative clause within a relative clause, which can make it challenging to parse. However, each part of the sentence is correctly constructed, making the sentence grammatically correct."
19,"The trophy that the athlete who the restaurant had hired as a spokesman was stolen later","Center Embedding","ungrammatical","N","N","N The sentence is not grammatically correct. It seems to be missing a verb related to the athlete and is also awkwardly structured. A corrected version of the sentence could be: ""The trophy of the athlete, whom the restaurant had hired as a spokesman, was stolen later."" or ""The trophy that belonged to the athlete, who had been hired by the restaurant as a spokesman, was stolen later."""
20,"The apartment that the maid who the service had sent over was well decorated","Center Embedding","ungrammatical","N","N","N"
21,"The shirt that the seamstress who the immigration officer had investigated last week needed to be dry cleaned","Center Embedding","ungrammatical","N","N","N"

23,"More gym instructors won a marathon yesterday than lawyers did","Comparative Illusion","grammatical","C","C","C"
24,"Last month more couples had their second child than Sandra's sister did","Comparative Illusion","ungrammatical","C","N","N The sentence ""Last month more couples had their second child than Sandra's sister did"" is not grammatically correct because it compares two different things that are not directly comparable. It compares the number of couples who had their second child to what Sandra's sister did, which is not specified and thus makes the sentence confusing. A corrected version could be: ""Last month, more couples had their second child than Sandra's sister had children."" This assumes that Sandra's sister had fewer than two children, making the comparison valid. If the intent is to compare the number of second children, it should be clear what Sandra's sister's situation is in relation to that."
25,"More Americans began law school this week than Canadians did","Comparative Illusion","grammatical","C","C","C The sentence ""More Americans began law school this week than Canadians did"" is grammatically correct. It compares the number of Americans to the number of Canadians who began law school in a specific week, using the structure ""more [group one] than [group two] did"" to make the comparison."
26,"This month more one-year-olds took their first steps than 10-month-olds did","Comparative Illusion","grammatical","C","N","N"
27,"Today more Brazilians immigrated to Japan than Chileans did","Comparative Illusion","grammatical","C","C","C"
28,"More 18-year-olds voted in this election than 40-year-olds did","Comparative Illusion","grammatical","C","C","C"
29,"More photographers won their third Pulitzer this year than the professor did","Comparative Illusion","ungrammatical","C","N","N The sentence ""More photographers won their third Pulitzer this year than the professor did"" is not grammatically correct because it suggests a comparison between the number of photographers who won their third Pulitzer and the number of Pulitzers won by the professor, which is not a logical comparison. A corrected version could be: ""More photographers won their third Pulitzer this year than the professor has ever won."" or ""More photographers won a Pulitzer this year than the professor did.""  This would depend on what you are trying to convey. If you are comparing the number of photographers who won a Pulitzer to whether the professor won one this year, the second sentence would be appropriate. If you are comparing the number of third-time winners to the total number of Pulitzers the professor has won over time, the first sentence would be more appropriate."
30,"More girls graduated from high school last year than John did","Comparative Illusion","ungrammatical","N","N","N"
31,"This semester more foreign applicants got into Stanford than Marie did","Comparative Illusion","ungrammatical","C","N","N The sentence ""This semester more foreign applicants got into Stanford than Marie did"" is not grammatically correct because it compares two different things that are not directly comparable in the way the sentence is structured. It compares the number of foreign applicants to a single person, Marie, which is illogical in this context. A more grammatically correct version could be: ""This semester, more foreign applicants got into Stanford than in the semester when Marie did."" or if the intention is to compare the success rate: ""This semester, more foreign applicants got into Stanford than Marie did."" (implying that Marie also applied but with less success compared to the number of foreign applicants who were admitted)"
32,"More boys got an A on the exam yesterday than she did","Comparative Illusion","ungrammatical","C","N","N"
33,"This is the boy that the cop who was leading the operation beat up","Intrusive Resumption","grammatical","C","C","C The sentence ""This is the boy that the cop who was leading the operation beat up"" is grammatically correct. It uses a relative clause ""that the cop who was leading the operation beat up"" to provide more information about ""the boy."" The sentence structure is complex, but it follows the rules of English grammar."
34,"This is the competition that the athletes who were feeling tired gave it up","Intrusive Resumption","ungrammatical","N","N","N"
35,"This is the girl that the child who was playing with the doll loved","Intrusive Resumption","grammatical","C","C","C"

38,"These are the cakes that the pastry chefs who were participating in the competition baked","Intrusive Resumption","grammatical","C","C","C The sentence ""These are the cakes that the pastry chefs who were participating in the competition baked"" is grammatically correct in English. It uses a relative clause to provide additional information about the cakes, specifying that they were baked by pastry chefs who were participating in a competition."
39,"This is the girl that the boy who was working with the gardener courted her","Intrusive Resumption","ungrammatical","N","N","N The sentence is not grammatically correct. The word ""her"" is unnecessary because ""the girl"" is already the object of the verb ""courted."" The correct sentence would be: ""This is the girl that the boy who was working with the gardener courted."""
40,"This is the actress that the judge who was working at Cannes admired her","Intrusive Resumption","ungrammatical","N","N","N The sentence ""This is the actress that the judge who was working at Cannes admired her"" is not grammatically correct. The word ""her"" is unnecessary and makes the sentence incorrect because ""that"" already serves as the object of the verb ""admired."" The correct sentence would be: ""This is the actress that the judge who was working at Cannes admired."" Or, for a more formal tone: ""This is the actress whom the judge who was working at Cannes admired."""
41,"This is the mug that the artisans who were working with ceramics crafted it","Intrusive Resumption","ungrammatical","N","N","N"
42,"This is the dictionary entry that the students who were doing the exam looked it up","Intrusive Resumption","ungrammatical","N","N","N"

49,"The soldiers that no diplomats supported have shown any bravery in the controversial war","NPIs","ungrammatical","N","N","N The sentence ""The soldiers that no diplomats supported have shown any bravery in the controversial war"" is not grammatically correct. It seems to be attempting to convey that the soldiers who were not supported by diplomats have not shown bravery. However, the sentence structure is confusing and the use of ""any"" is incorrect in this negative context. A grammatically correct version of the sentence could be: ""The soldiers who received no support from diplomats have shown no bravery in the controversial war."" This revised sentence clearly states that the soldiers who were not supported by diplomats have not shown bravery."
50,"The professors that no students respected have ever wanted negativity in a class debate","NPIs","ungrammatical","N","N","N"
51,"The comments that no politicians ignored have caused any bitterness toward the liberal newspapers","NPIs","ungrammatical","N","N","N The sentence ""The comments that no politicians ignored have caused any bitterness toward the liberal newspapers"" is not grammatically correct. The double negative (""no politicians ignored"") creates confusion, and the use of ""any"" in this context is also incorrect. A clearer way to phrase this might be: ""The comments that all politicians noticed have caused bitterness toward the liberal newspapers."" or ""No comments were ignored by the politicians, which has caused bitterness toward the liberal newspapers."""
52,"The lawyers that no businessmen respected have ever received criticism for a bad trial","NPIs","ungrammatical","N","N","N The sentence ""The lawyers that no businessmen respected have ever received criticism for a bad trial"" is not grammatically correct. The sentence structure is confusing, and the use of ""have ever"" is incorrect in this context. A clearer way to phrase this might be: ""The lawyers whom no businessmen respected have never received criticism for a bad trial."" or ""No lawyers that businessmen have respected have ever received criticism for a bad trial."" Depending on the intended meaning, the sentence should be restructured for clarity."
