# Raw data from Dentella et al. (2023)

The file `LM_grammaticality_data.xlsx` was downloaded from the OSF repository for DGL's original paper ([https://osf.io/s5nup](https://osf.io/s5nup)).
The file `LM_grammaticality_data.csv` was obtained by exporting the Excel file to a CSV.

We use the file `stimuli.csv` in the `stimuli` folder (in the parent directory) as inputs to models for evaluation.
This file was obtained by running `python extract_stimuli.py`.
